# Chart Challenge

From [The crypto craftsman](https://thecryptocraftsman.com/blog/4)

## Concept

- Get a random crypto candlestick chart, daily, not labeled
- Place a simulated OCO on let's say 30 days
- Simulate associated revenues and contributes to your score
- Quickly play and learn to increase your chart reading skills

## Limits

- Naked chart for now
